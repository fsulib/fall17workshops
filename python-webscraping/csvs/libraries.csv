Connecting and collaborating with colleagues in the publishing industry is essential, but should come with the understanding that the library as an organization is access-prone. This article discusses the complexities of navigating that relationship, and calls for libraries and publishers to embrace and respect the position from which we begin. Finally, the article forecasts several possible characteristics of what ""publishing"" might look like if libraries press the principle of access in this growing area.",2014,"FSU_migr_library_faculty_publications-0011, 10.6084/m9.figshare.1088945",Citation

fsu:252673,Academic Librariesâ€”Measuring Up: Assessment and Collaboration for Student Success.,"Besara, Rachel, Kinsley, Kirsten Michele","Purpose: This paper aims to describe how the Florida State University Libraries used assessment data with other campus partners to gain funding and resources for new initiatives. When general funding sources were threatened, alternative funding sources from these campus partners were used to jumpâ€êstart new initiatives designed to enhance student success. Design/methodology/approach â€“ This paper is a case study of how assessment data fueled the creation of a new lateâ€ênight peerâ€êtutoring program at the Florida State University Libraries. The three main data conduits that inspired a new tutoring program were: an ethnographic study of undergraduate students, undergraduate courses with high failure/high enrolment/high drop rates, and an environmental scan of existing campus tutoring. Findings: â€“ Sharing assessment data with key partners can leverage funding and resources for new initiatives. Social implications: In hard budgetary times, opportunities for funding and resources may arise when shared values between campus constituencies are met with assessment data. Libraries need to take a leadership role in gathering and sharing those data with other campus constituents in order to place libraries in a strategic position to receive alternative funding for shared initiatives. Originality/value: Other libraries may use this case as a model, sharing their assessment results with the campus community, especially with those campus constituencies where there is a relationship already in place, to garner further support for piloting innovative services.",2011,"FSU_migr_library_faculty_publications-0020, 10.1108/03074801111182012",Citation

fsu:371257,Acquisitions Everywhere: Modeling an Acquisitions Data Standard to Connect a Distributed Environment.,"Hanson, Eric M., Lightcap, Paul W., Miguez, Matthew R.","Acquisitions functions remain operationally crucial in providing access to paid information resources, but data formats and workflows utilized within library acquisitions remain primarily within the traditional integrated library system (ILS). As libraries have evolved to use distributed systems to manage information resources, so too must acquisitions functions adapt to an environment that may include the ILS, eâ€êresource management systems (ERMS), institutional repositories (IR), and other digital asset management systems (DAMS). This presentation is intended to articulate a vision for applying standardsâ€êbased practiceâ€”as already employed for resource descriptionâ€”to acquisitions functions in a variety of metadata schema and systems. Utilization of standards will be demonstrated in the proposal of a core acquisitions element set that can exist in any system, with proofs of concept including demonstration of the element set within MODS, JSON, and how it may be reflected within the ILS and ERMS. Building on these proofs of concept in recording interoperable acquisitions data will be an explanation of possible applications, including an exploration of more robust support for semantic web technologies. In particular, this presentation will explore how this element set could utilize published linked datasets, such as the North Carolina State University Organization Name Linked Data and Global Open Knowledgebase (GOKb) linked data service, to provide more accurate and efficient identity management.",10/17/16,"FSU_libsubv1_scholarship_submission_1476791944, 10.5703/1288284316250",Citation

Unfortunately, however, there is no natural constituency for the academic library. While the library may have been instrumental in their successful academic career, alumni more often than not, feel no loyalty to it, as they might to their department, school, college, or even sports team. The school library, which may have served as the important cog in their academic success, is taken for granted in its apparent supporting role. <p id=""x-x-p-2"">Until recently, solidifying a donor base was of little consequence to the academic library; college and university libraries got by with minimal fundraising, often assisted by friends groups that provide financial support via annual membership fees and occasional fundraising events. College and university libraries friends groups are frequently made up of current and retired faculty and librarians, who understand the important role of the campus library. The trick for academic libraries in the current economy is to bring in new life and new blood in support of the library. <p id=""x-x-p-3"">A key to this concept is to connect the interests of potential donors with the goals and objectives of the library. Current and retired faculty and library staff understand the importance of the library and its mission; but how can the library communicate its mission in a way that attracts alumni and other community supporters?",2013,FSU_migr_library_faculty_publications-0005,Citation

fsu:277450,The Copyright Modernization Act: A guide for post-secondary instructors.,"Soper, Devin","In November 2012, the educational provisions of the Copyright Modernization Act were proclaimed in force, thereby introducing a number of significant changes to the Canadian Copyright Act. These changes include the expansion of fair dealing to include the purpose of education, the addition of new educational exceptions for the online transmission of lessons and the use of work freely available through the internet, and a number of amendments that make existing educational exceptions more technologically accommodating. This paper considers the significance of these changes for post-secondary instructors, first contextualizing the changes in relation to recent fair dealing jurisprudence, and then considering their significance for everyday instructional practice. Drawing on influential court decisions and the commentary of academics and lawyers, the paper not only describes how the changes to the Copyright Act have expanded the rights and exceptions available to instructors, but also identifies a number of unresolved questions about how the changes should be applied in practice. Despite these areas of uncertainty, the paper concludes that the changes bode well for post-secondary instructors, as they relax many long-standing restrictions around the use of copyrighted works for educational purposes.",7/6/13,"FSU_libsubv1_scholarship_submission_1891, 10.5206/cjsotl-rcacea.2013.1.6",Citation

This poster session outlines semi-automated methods for achieving accurate transcription of bibliographic data in theses and dissertations for both digital repository and catalog records. Earlier methods involved digital repository staff manually inputting bibliographic data then cataloging staff copying that data from the digital repository website into a MARC template along with additional information from the PDF. With the new workflow, manual transcription of bibliographic information found in the PDF is replaced with automated extraction of the PDF data. The extracted PDF data and the ProQuest metadata are used as common source data for XSLT (eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) programs to generate metadata for both the digital repository (Bepress) and the catalog (MARC21XML). Common modular XSLT programs are included in both transformations, and common XML reference tables provide an index of shared data values. The advantage of this new method is that it combines the quality control of transcription taken directly from the PDF with the time efficiency of automated repurposing of ProQuest metadata. By using common data sources, transformations, and reference tables, the metadata is accurate and consistent for both the digital repository and the catalog. And since staff time is greatly reduced, the ETDs are made available to patrons more quickly.",2014,FSU_migr_library_faculty_publications-0014,Citation

Using the think-aloud protocol, observers could hear students express their internal decisions, thoughts, and feelings about the process. Results confirmed trouble spots in the building and that directories are not typically used and need updating. GoPro footage revealed that there are certain qualities of the help-desk experience that can make a search more or less successful. No major sex differences were found in preference of wayfinding tools and behaviors, except that males appear to have used directories marginally more than females. In a debriefing survey, students still affirmed human help and online maps as the most useful wayfinding tools and advocated for better signage.

fsu:277429,Green Libraries on the Cheap.,"Fallik, Sarah, Soper, Devin, Sparks, Kaitlyn","""Going green,"" or becoming more environmentally conscious, has become a mounting international concern in recent decades. The increasing global consumption of finite resources has led to large-scale societal campaigns to heighten awareness about environmental issues and concerns. With interest in environmental sustainability on the rise, libraries are increasingly deciding to undertake their own green initiatives. And why not? Libraries that embrace greener practices reinforce ""their roles as community/cultural centers that significantly and positively impact the quality of life of those they serve"" (Mulford & Himmel, 2010). Additionally, green library initiatives are a wonderful means of building community partnerships, demonstrating effective leadership, and enhancing the library's public profile (Brodie, 2012). So what exactly does it mean to be a ""green library""? The designation is difficult to define, but, generally speaking, libraries that implement green practices are committed to pursuing innovation, to minimizing waste, and, where possible, to adopting and promoting environmentally sound processes throughout their organizations (Schaper, 2010). While these aspirations are admirable, it is easy to lose sight of them, especially in times of widespread economic hardship and dwindling library budgets. In light of these difficulties, the challenge of optimizing library facilities, operations, and collections can seem overwhelming, and the potential costs can be intimidating. Contrary to these impressions, libraries can work toward a more sustainable future through relatively simple, inexpensive measures, and many changes can actually save money in the long term. This article outlines a variety of practical strategies for implementing greener practices within the context of budget limitations. Most of these strategies can be employed at minimal cost, and, taken together, they can serve as a powerful catalyst for change.

Open Access Week 2013 occurred in the last full week of October, the 21st through 27th. This was the sixth year that Open Access Week was celebrated, and the fourth year it was observed at Florida State University. This year's theme for Open Access Week was ""Redefining Impact."" As open access is generally heralded by librarians, events and initiatives around that topic are hosted by Florida State University Libraries. Following the lead of other universities that hosted Open Access Week events, the 2010 and 2011 programs included lectures, panels and discussions. While the programs were generally well-regarded and in line with current events and interesting topics, they were largely attended by open access advocates and librarians. As the goals of FSU's open access program became clearer, the decision was made that lectures and panels hosted in the library were not achieving the desired effect of raising campus-wide awareness about open access. The 2012 initiative for Open Access Week took the form of an information campaign, including eight posters, informational brochures, and staff time spent at an information table in the main floor of the library. While unable to measure effectiveness by numbers of attendees, it became apparent that the level of knowledge about open access is increasing as outreach takes new flavors.",2013,FSU_migr_library_faculty_publications-0009,Citation

Successful socialization can increase librarians' commitments to and retention in the libraries, which may enhance the quality of information services to library patrons. In addition to collecting demographic information, we measured the organizational socialization of 314 academic librarians using Chao, O'Leary-Kelly, Wolf, Klein, and Gardner's (1994) content framework. Study participants possessed high levels of socialization in their libraries overall. They were well socialized in Politics, followed by Performance Proficiency (task/skills), and Language; however, their socialization in Organizational goals/values, History, and People were relatively low, suggesting that there is room for improvement. Other key findings are: (1) male participants had lower levels of socialization in the People dimension than did females; (2) participants who were tenured had higher levels of socialization than did those who had not yet achieved tenure; (3) participants who had informal mentoring experiences had higher levels of socialization overall compared to those who had not received any mentoring; and (4) participants' socialization was associated negatively with the number of employees in their libraries and with the highest degree offered by their institutions. The study findings can be used to understand the learning and adjustment process of academic librarians in the United States, predict their retention and job satisfaction, and develop and improve library training or orientation programs.

It uses rigorous research methods to measure whether the classroom intervention impacts student perceptions and success outcomes. Design/methodology/approach â€“ Longitudinal, mixed-methods approach that attempts to measure the outcome of an experimental class that uses precision (exact) matching to control for extraneous variables that impact student success and a survey to measure student perceptions. Findings â€“ Librarians can benefit by collaborating with faculty to learn more rigorous research methods. Precision (exact) matching a control group with an experimental group is time-intensive, but easily replicated. Preliminary results are very promising for both the precision matching and the survey data. It appears that students are able to learn critical thinking, research and writing skills from the collaboration between discipline-specific faculty, librarians and reading writing center tutors. Research limitations/implications â€“ Precision (exact) matching a control group with an experimental group is time-intensive. Thus, the results need to be viewed cautiously due to the small sample size. Practical implications â€“ Combining efforts to conduct collaborative research and instruction between libraries and faculty can provide resources for applications of the model with other disciplines. Originality/value â€“ The library-intensive freshman writing seminar is a unique approach to student learning and an easy way for the library to be actively integrated in other disciplines. The precision matching technique is a methodologically rigorous research design that easy to replicate in other locations and with other disciplines.",2014,"FSU_migr_library_faculty_publications-0016, 10.1108/NLW-05-2014-0057",Citation

fsu:252672,Researching Long Island History During the CETA Program: How I Became an Archivist.,"Altman, Burt","Introduction by John A. Strong Professor Emeritus, Long Island University: About twenty years ago when I was working with Gaynell Stone on the Suffolk County Archaeological Association series on Long Island Indians she sent me to the Nassau County Parks facility at Sands Point to look at a collection of bibliographic cards that were stored there. Dan Kaplan, a park staff member, ushered me to a big empty library area, seated me at a long table, and brought me several long rectangular boxes filled with hundreds of three by five index cards with writing on both sides. I was amazed and overwhelmed. He told me that Burt Altman, a CETA intern, had prepared them back in the 1960s and left when the grant funds ran out. They were, Dan said, dumped here because no one knew what to do with them. For me, the boxes were a gold mine full of leads to obscure archives. I took extensive notes and made some Xerox copies. The short annotations on the backs of the bibliographic citations were extremely helpful. The cards were moved from the repository during a time when funds were being cut and some staff retired. Efforts to locate them are now being made by Herb Mills, former Nassau County Museum Director and Gary Haglich, former director of exhibits. Burt Altman's experience is a reaffirmation of Johnson's oft-maligned War on Poverty. As we approach the fiftieth anniversary of the program, scholars are re-evaluating Johnson's vision and his domestic policies. Johnson's historic attempt to reduce inequality was pushed into the background of the public awareness by his disastrous Vietnam policy. Altman's story reminds us that much good came from Johnson's more humane War on Poverty policy. Now that the concern about inequality has once again emerged, let us hope that we can advance the mission set in motion by Lyndon Johnson.",2015,FSU_migr_library_faculty_publications-0018,Citation

By combing methods of a hands on approach (finding, describing and the interpretation of a primary source), with search strategies for online primary source materials and identifying more sources using a ""lead"" research method â€“ using bibliographies and subject encyclopedias to identify more sources â€“ I guide individuals and classes through the rich array of research materials in our library and beyond and that primary sources are not just kept in a Special Collections, but where, what they are and how to use them.",2011,FSU_migr_sca-0004,Citation
