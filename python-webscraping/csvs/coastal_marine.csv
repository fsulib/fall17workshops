fsu:209859,"Age, Growth, and Reproductive Biology of Cownose Rays in Chesapeake Bay.","Fisher, Robert, Call, Garrett, Grubbs, Dean","The Cownose Ray Rhinoptera bonasus is an opportunistic predator of benthic invertebrates and has had a long history of negative interactions with commercial shellfish industries. Most recently, Cownose Rays have been implicated in negatively affecting the recovery of bay scallop Argopecten irradians stocks in North Carolina and oyster restoration and commercial aquaculture efforts in Chesapeake Bay. A mitigation attempt to decrease predation on shellfish has resulted in an unregulated fishery for Cownose Rays. Cownose Ray life history suggests that they are highly susceptible to overexploitation. We determined age, growth, and size at maturity for Cownose Rays collected in Chesapeake Bay. In total, 694 rays were used for the study: 246 males ranging in size from 30.0 to 98.0 cm disc width (DW) and 448 females ranging from 30.0 to 110.5 cm DW. The oldest individual observed was a female (107 cm DW) estimated at age 21. Our data suggested that Cownose Rays grow considerably faster during the first few years than has been previously reported, thus producing higher estimates of the growth coefficient k. The best-fit growth models (three-parameter von Bertalanffy models) estimated k-values of 0.2741 for males and 0.1931 for females. The large sample size and inclusion ofmany older animals (n = 119 rays over age 10) resulted in theoreticalmaximum size estimates that matched the observed sizes well. The median size at 50% maturity was 85â€“86 cm DW for males and females (corresponding to ages of âˆ_6â€“7 for males and âˆ_7â€“8 for females). Fecundity in Cownose Rays was typically one embryo per mature female, with a gestation period of 11â€“12 months. Our study confirms that the Cownose Ray is a K-selected species with late maturity, long gestation, and low reproductive potential, indicating that it could be highly susceptible to overexploitation.",2013,"FSU_migr_marinelab_pubs-0003, 10.1080/19425120.2013.812587",Citation
fsu:388873,Bacterial Community Diversity Of The Deep-sea Octocoral Paramuricea Placomus.,"Kellogg, Christina A., Ross, Steve W., Brooke, Sandra D.","Compared to tropical corals, muth less is known about deep-sea coral biology and ecology. Although the microbial communities of some deep-sea corals have been described this is the first study to characterize the bacterial community associated wide) the deep-sea octocoral, Paramuncea Placornus. Samples from five colonies of P. placomus were collected from Baltimore Canyon (379-382 m depth) in the Atlantic Ocean off the east coast of the United States of America. DNA was extracted from the coral samples and 16S rRNA gene amplicons were pyrosequenced using V4-V5 primers. Three samples sequenced deeply (>4,000 sequences each) and were further analyzed. The dominant microbial phylum was Proteobacteria, but other major phyla included Firmicutes and Planctomycetes. A conserved community of bacterial taxa held in common across the three P. placomus colonies was identified, comprising 68-90% of the total bacterial community depending on the coral individual. The bacterial community of P. placomus does not appear to include the genus Endozoicomonas, which has been found previously to be the dominant bacterial associate in several temperate and tropical gorgonians. Inferred functionality suggests the possibility of nitrogen cycling by the core bacterial community.",9/29/16,"FSU_libsubv1_wos_000385572500006, 10.7717/peerj.2529",Citation
fsu:398898,Coral-Associated Bacterial Diversity Is Conserved across Two Deep-Sea Anthothela Species.,"Lawler, Stephanie N., Kellogg, Christina A., France, Scott C., Clostio, Rachel W., Brooke, Sandra D., Ross, Steve W.","Cold-water corals, similar to tropical corals, contain diverse and complex microbial assemblages. These bacteria provide essential biological functions within coral holobionts, facilitating increased nutrient utilization and production of antimicrobial compounds. To date, few cold-water octocoral species have been analyzed to explore the diversity and abundance of their microbial associates. For this study, 23 samples of the family Anthothelidae were collected from Norfolk (n = 12) and Baltimore Canyons (n = 11) from the western Atlantic in August 2012 and May 2013. Genetic testing found that these samples comprised two Anthothela species (Anthothela grandiflora and Anthothela sp.) and Alcyonium grandiflorurn. DNA was extracted and sequenced with primers targeting the V4-V5 variable region of the 16S rRNA gene using 454 pyrosequencing with GS FLX Titanium chemistry. Results demonstrated that the coral host was the primary driver of bacterial community composition. Al. grandiflorum, dominated by Alteromonadales and Pirellulales had much higher species richness, and a distinct bacterial community compared to Anthothela samples. Anthothela species (A. grandiflora and Anthothela sp.) had very similar bacterial communities, dominated by Oceanospirillales and Spirochaetes. Additional analysis of core-conserved bacteria at 90% sample coverage revealed genus level conservation across Anthothela samples. This core included unclassified Oceanospirillales, Kiloniellales, Campylobacterales, and genus Spirochaeta. Members of this core were previously recognized for their functional capabilities in nitrogen cycling and suggest the possibility of a nearly complete nitrogen cycle within Anthothela species. Overall, many of the bacterial associates identified in this study have the potential to contribute to the acquisition and cycling of nutrients within the coral holobiont.",4/5/16,"FSU_libsubv1_wos_000373321300001, 10.3389/fmicb.2016.00458",Citation
fsu:209860,Cownose Ray (Rhinoptera Bonasus) Predation Relative to Bivalve Ontogeny.,"Fisher, Robert, Call, Garrett, Grubbs, Dean","The purpose of this study was to determine the ability of the cownose ray, Rhinoptera bonasus (Mitchill, 1815), to manipulate oysters and clams, to test for relative prey preference, and to investigate whether susceptibility to cownose ray predation changes with bivalve ontogeny. We investigated patterns of predation for captive adult and young-of-year cownose rays on 4 species of bivalves, including Crassostrea virginica (Gmelin, 1791), Crassostrea ariakensis (Fujita, 1913), Mercenaria mercenaria (Linnaeus, 1758), and Mya arenaria Linnaeus, 1758. In oyster (C. virginica) trials, predation probabilities by adult rays were highest at shell heights of 30â€“70 mm and shell depths of 8â€“22 mm. The rates of predation by adult rays in trials in which samesize oysters were used were higher than rates in most comingled trials. Adult rays showed no differences in predation between native oysters (C. virginica) and nonnative oysters (C. ariakensis; P > 0.05). Adult rays selected hard- and soft-shell clams (Manly-Chesson index M. mercenaria, Î± = 0.736 Â± 0.002, electivity = 0.473 Â± 0.007; M. arenaria, Î± = 0.742 Â± 0.003, electivity = 0.485 Â± 0.013) over oysters (C. virginica, Î± = 0.263 Â± 0.002, electivity = -0.473 Â± 0.007; Î± = 0.257 Â± 0.003, electivity = -0.485 Â± 0.003). In young-of-year feeding trials, oysters with a shell height of 10â€“35 mm and a shell depth of 3â€“12 mm had the highest probability of predation. Native oyster and hard clam peak force or load crush tests resulted in forces of 200â€“1,500 N and 400â€“1,400 N across shell depths of 10â€“35 mm and 21â€“34 mm, respectively, before valve failure. The results of this study indicate that cownose ray predation on shellfish is limited by shell size and is likely related to ray jaw gape and bite force.",2011,"FSU_migr_marinelab_pubs-0004, 10.2983/035.030.0126",Citation
fsu:400921,Critical assessment and ramifications of a purported marine trophic cascade.,"Grubbs, R. Dean, Carlson, John K., Romine, Jason G., Curtis, Tobey H., McElroy, W. David, McCandless, Camilla T., Cotton, Charles F., Musick, John A.","When identifying potential trophic cascades, it is important to clearly establish the trophic linkages between predators and prey with respect to temporal abundance, demographics, distribution, and diet. In the northwest Atlantic Ocean, the depletion of large coastal sharks was thought to trigger a trophic cascade whereby predation release resulted in increased cownose ray abundance, which then caused increased predation on and subsequent collapse of commercial bivalve stocks. These claims were used to justify the development of a predator-control fishery for cownose rays, the ""Save the Bay, Eat a Ray"" fishery, to reduce predation on commercial bivalves. A reexamination of data suggests declines in large coastal sharks did not coincide with purported rapid increases in cownose ray abundance. Likewise, the increase in cownose ray abundance did not coincide with declines in commercial bivalves. The lack of temporal correlations coupled with published diet data suggest the purported trophic cascade is lacking the empirical linkages required of a trophic cascade. Furthermore, the life history parameters of cownose rays suggest they have low reproductive potential and their populations are incapable of rapid increases. Hypothesized trophic cascades should be closely scrutinized as spurious conclusions may negatively influence conservation and management decisions.",2/15/16,"FSU_libsubv1_wos_000370055800001, 10.1038/srep20970",Citation
fsu:252465,"From Shelf to Shelf: Assessing Historical and Contemporary Genetic Differentiation and Connectivity across the Gulf of Mexico in Gag, Mycteroperca microlepis.","Jue, Nathaniel Kenneth, Brule, Thierry, Coleman, Felicia C., Koenig, Christopher C.","Describing patterns of connectivity among populations of species with widespread distributions is particularly important in understanding the ecology and evolution of marine species. In this study, we examined patterns of population differentiation, migration, and historical population dynamics using microsatellite and mitochondrial loci to test whether populations of the epinephelid fish, Gag, Mycteroperca microlepis, an important fishery species, are genetically connected across the Gulf of Mexico and if so, whether that connectivity is attributable to either contemporary or historical processes. Populations of Gag on the Campeche Bank and the West Florida Shelf show significant, but low magnitude, differentiation. Time since divergence/expansion estimates associated with historical population dynamics indicate that any population or spatial expansions indicated by population genetics would have likely occurred in the late Pleistocene. Using coalescent-based approaches, we find that the best model for explaining observed spatial patterns of contemporary genetic variation is one of asymmetric gene flow, with movement from Campeche Bank to the West Florida Shelf. Both estimated migration rates and ecological data support the hypothesis that Gag populations throughout the Gulf of Mexico are connected via present day larval dispersal. Demonstrating this greatly expanded scale of connectivity for Gag highlights the influence of ""ghost"" populations (sensu Beerli) on genetic patterns and presents a critical consideration for both fisheries management and conservation of this and other species with similar genetic patterns.",2015,"FSU_migr_marinelab_pubs-0005, 10.1371/journal.pone.0120676",Citation

Research on rare and threatened species is often limited by access to sufficient individuals to acquire information needed to design appropriate conservation measures. 2. Using a combination of data from pop-up archival transmitting (PAT) tags across multiple institutional programmes, movements and habitat use of endangered smalltooth sawfish, Pristis pectinata were determined for animals from southern Florida and the Bahamas. 3. All P. pectinata (n =12) generally remained in coastal waters within the region where they were initially tagged, travelling an average of 80.2 km from deployment to pop-up location. The shortest distance moved was 4.6 km and the greatest 279.1 km, averaging 1.4 km day-1. Seasonal movement rates for females were significantly different with the greatest movements in autumn and winter. 4. Pristis pectinata spent the majority of their time at shallow depths (96% of their time at depths <10 m) and warm water temperatures (22â€“28Â°C). 5. Given sawfish show a degree of site fidelity punctuated by limited migratory movements emphasizes the need for conservation and management of existing coastal habitats throughout the species' range.

fsu:209857,Sexually Dimorphic Morphological Characters in Five North Atlantic Deepwater Skates (Chondrichthyes: Rajiformes).,"Orlov, Alexei, Cotton, Charles","Skates exhibit a variety of manifestations of sexual dimorphism. However, this phenomenon has been poorly documented in deepwater species. New data on the sexual dimorphism of five species of deepwater skates from the North Atlantic Ocean are presented: Amblyraja jenseni, Bathyraja pallida, Bathyraja richardsoni, Rajella bigelowi, and R. kukujevi. These skates exhibit sexual dimorphism most frequently in interorbital width, disc length and width, length of the third gill slit, horizontal diameter of the orbit, length of the fifth gill slit, space between the first and fifth gill slits, length of the second dorsal fin base, mouth width, length and width of each lobe of the nasal curtain, distance from the snout to the center of anus, distance from the snout tip to the point of maximum disc width, length of the lateral fold, length of the orbit + spiracle (measured together), tail height at the pelvic fin tips, and the number of median thorns.",2011,"FSU_migr_marinelab_pubs-0001, 10.1155/2011/842821",Citation
