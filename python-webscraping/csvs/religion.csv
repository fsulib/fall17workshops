fsu:209940,"Aggressive Philanthropy: Progressivism, Conservatism, and the William Volker Charities Fund.","McVicar, Michael J.","This essay explores the history of the William Volker Charities Fund, a significant charitable organization founded in 1932 by William Volker, a Kansas City furniture manufacturer. A self-describe progressive, Volker was a prominent Kansas Citian who earned the nickname Mr. Anonymous because he ssecretly gave away most of his personal fortune to create the city's private/public welfare system in the first half of the twentieth century. After Volker's death, Harold W. Luhnow, Volker's nephew, used the fund's resources to move from progressive concerns related to social welfare to support free market, libertarian, and conservative intellectuals after World War II. Before collapsing in the late 1960s, the fund financed the early careers of five Nobel Prize winners; prominent figures in what would become the Religious Right; controversial revisionist historians; and, numerous conservative writers, publishers, and public figures.",2011,FSU_migr_rel_faculty_publications-0007,Citation

Sponsored by a major grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, a U.S. government agency that funds humanities research, the institute invited twelve scholars—seven from the U.S. and five from Europe—whose work at the intersection of digital technologies and their disciplinary domains (history, religious studies, literary studies, geography and geographic information science, archaeology, and museum studies) promised to advance an institute aim of re-envisioning the theories and technologies of spatialization to serve the needs of humanities research more completely.",2013,"FSU_migr_rel_faculty_publications-0008, 10.3366/ijhac.2013.0087",Citation
fsu:209937,"Discerning Trajectories: 4QInstruction and the Sapiential Background of the Sayings Source.","Goff, Matthew J.","This article argues that 4QInstruction, considered to be the largest wisdom text of the Dead Sea Scrolls, does not symbolize the redaction of different sapiential and apocalyptic layers in Q. Issues in the study of Q are given. The relationship between Q and Jewish wisdom is discussed. It analyzes the theme of revelation in 4QInstruction.",2005,FSU_migr_rel_faculty_publications-0001,Citation
fsu:209939,"Gilgamesh the Giant: The Qumran Book of Giants' Appropriation of Gilgamesh Motifs.","Goff, Matthew J.","The Qumran Book of Giants shows familiarity with lore from the classic Mesopotamian Epic of Gilgamesh. It has been proposed that the author of the Book of Giants drew from the epic in order to polemicize against it. There is much to commend this view. The name of the hero of the tale is given to one of the murderous, wicked giants of the primordial age. Examination of fragments of the Book of Giants, in particular 4Q530 2 ii and 4Q531 22, however, suggests that key aspects of its portrayal of Gilgamesh the giant cannot be explained as polemic against Mesopotamian literary traditions. The Book of Giants creatively appropriates motifs from the epic and makes Gilgamesh a character in his own right in ways that often have little to do with Gilgamesh.",2009,"FSU_migr_rel_faculty_publications-0003, 10.1163/156851709X395740",Citation
