            <p>After dyuerse werkes made / translated and achieued / hauyng noo werke in hande. I
              sittyng in my studye where as laye many dyuerse paunflettis and bookys. happened that
              to my hande cam a lytyl booke in frenshe. whiche late was translated oute of latyn by
              some noble clerke of fraūce whiche booke is named Eneydos / made in latyn by that
              noble poete &amp; grete clerke vyrgyle / whiche booke I sawe ouer and redde therin.
              How after the generall destruccyon of the grete Troye, Eneas departed berynge his olde
              fader anchises vpon his sholdres / his lityl son yolus on his honde. his wyfe wyth
              moche other people folowynge / and how he shypped and departed wyth alle thystorye of
              his aduentures that he had er he cam to the achieuement of his conquest of ytalye as
              all a longe shall be shewed in this present boke. In whi­che booke I had grete
              playsyr. by cause of the fayr and honest termes &amp; wordes in frenshe / whyche I
              neuer sawe to fo­re lyke. ne none so playsaunt ne so wel ordred. whiche boo­ke as me
              semed sholde be moche requysyte to noble men to see as wel for the eloquence as the
              historyes / How wel that many honderd yerys passed was the sayd booke of eneydos wyth
              other werkes made and lerned dayly in scolis specyal­ly in ytalye &amp; other places /
              whiche historye the sayd vyrgyle made in metre / And whan I had aduysed me in this
              sayd boke. I delybered and concluded to translate it in to englysshe And forthwyth
              toke a penne &amp; ynke and wrote a leef or tweyne / whyche I ouersawe agayn to
              corecte it / And whā I sawe the fayr &amp; straunge termes therin / I doubted that it
              sholde not please some gentylmen whiche late blamed me sayeng y<sup>t</sup> in my
              translacyons I had ouer curyous termes whiche coude not be vnderstande of comyn peple

              and redde therin / and certaynly the englysshe was so rude and brood that I coude not
              wele vnderstande it. And also my lorde abbot of westmynster ded do shewe to me late
              certa­yn euydences wryton in olde englysshe for to reduce it in to our englysshe now
              vsid / And certaynly it was wreton in suche wyse that it was more lyke to dutche than
              englysshe I coude not reduce ne brynge it to be vnderstonden / And cer­taynly our
              langage now vsed varyeth ferre from that. whiche was vsed and spoken whan I was borne
              / For we en­glysshe men / ben borne vnder the domynacyon of the mone. whiche is neuer
              stedfaste / but euer wauerynge / wexynge o­ne season / and waneth &amp; dyscreaseth
              another season / And that comyn englysshe that is spoken in one shyre varyeth from a
              nother. In so moche that in my dayes happened that certayn marchaūtes were in a ship̄
              in tamyse for to haue sayled ouer the see into zelande / and for lacke of wynde thei
              taryed atte forlond. and wente to lande for to refreshe them And one of theym named

              I stande abasshed. but in my Iudgemente / the comyn termes that be dayli vsed ben
              lyghter to be vnderstonde than the olde and aūcyent englys­she / And for as moche as
              this present booke is not for a rude vplondyssh man to laboure therin / ne rede it /
