# Fall Workshops - GitHub Edition

This repository is being used in the Fall 2017 digital research skills workshops held by the Office of Digital Research and Scholarship. It has an about-me.md file and a cv.md file, which contain information about me that was accurate in the fall of 2017. If you would like to see my actual, updated cv and bio, please visit https://scstanley.github.io instead of this!
