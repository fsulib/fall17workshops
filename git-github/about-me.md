# About Me

I am the digital humanities librarian at the Office of Digital Research and Scholarship at FSU Libraries. I received my master's in English from Northeastern University, where I studied medieval and early modern women's writing. I currently serve on the Text Encoding Initiative Technical Council. I am interested in creating shared infrastructures for digital projects, new modes of scholarly production, and creating meaningful and robust ways of facilitating scholarly communication in the digital age.

In my spare time, I enjoy singing with my local choir, baking (and eating) too many buttery baked goods, and walking everywhere.
